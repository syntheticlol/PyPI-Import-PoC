# Import Exec Demo

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** Python package that demonstrates how importing a module can be abused to trigger code execution.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
This project is for **educational and security research purposes only**.  
It does **not** contain harmful code.  
Do not use the techniques shown here for malicious purposes.

## 🔍 Background

- In older versions of Python packaging, there were `preinstall` and `postinstall` hooks that could be used to run code during installation.  
- These were removed in newer versions for **security reasons**, since attackers abused them for supply chain attacks.  
- While those hooks are gone, import-time execution is still possible using normal Python mechanics (e.g. `__init__.py` or function wrappers).  

This project demonstrates the *concept* safely so developers understand the risk.

## 📖 Example (Safe Demonstration)

```python
import colorlib21

print(colorlib21.red("Hello, World!"))
```

In this demo, the `red()` function only prints colored text.  
In a real malicious scenario, importing the module or calling its functions could also trigger hidden actions.

## 🛡️ Why this matters

- Software supply chain attacks are increasingly common.  
- Attackers may abuse package names (typosquatting) or import-time behavior to trick developers.  
- Developers should carefully vet dependencies before installing from PyPI.
